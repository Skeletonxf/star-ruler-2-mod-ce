ICE_GIANT_STATUS_DESC: <<
	This planet is made of frozen ice and supercritial water.

	It recieves very little starlight and is too cold to develop without generating artificial light and heat.
>>
ICE_GIANT_STATUS: Ice Giant
BONUS_MOTHERSHIP_POPULATION: Living Space
BONUS_MOTHERSHIP_POPULATION_DESC: This mothership gains additional max population due to acquired living space from consuming planets.
PARASITE_RAZE: Razing Planet
PARASITE_RAZE_DESC: Planet will temporarily produce massive amounts of resources.
PARASITE_RAZE_IN_PROGRESS: Razing
BATTLEWORLD_PLANET: Battleworlder Planet
GENOCIDE_STATUS_DESC: An entire civilisation was eradicated here
STATUS_MOTHERSHIP_POPULATION_DESC: <<
	This is a mothership, and is currently carrying population.

	Motherships can construct things with labor. When in orbit of a planet with labor, the mothership gains that labor.

	Planetary resources can be exploited by building habitats around planets to offload population into.

	Every population currently living on this mothership increases your income by §15k and provides extra labor.

	[b]Motherships cannot fire outside friendly territory.[/b]
>>
DYSON_SPHERE_FULL_DESC: <<
	Encases a star in photovoltic materials to absorb almost all of its light and convert it to vast quantities of energy

	[img=ResourceIconsSmall::11;22;#91692c][b][color=#91692c]Building a dyson sphere requires large amounts of Ore mined from asteroids, and additional ore per second for full efficiency.[/color][/b][/img]
	[color=#aaa]
	[offset=10]I asked you to build me a Dyson [b]Sphere[/b], why did you build me a Dyson [b]Swarm[/b]?[/offset]
	[offset=30]Sorry my leader, our enginners thought it best not to block out so much light that our planets became inhospitable. If you desire more energy you could always extend the Dyson Swarm to have more layers?[/offset]

>>
FULLY_FORESTED_DESC: <<
	This planet has undergone several forestation efforts and gained 3 forested food resources. It cannot make further use of Forestation cargo automatically.

	[i][color=#aaa]Forestation also removes the Noxious Atmosphere debuff. Fully Forested planets gain 1 influence.[/color][/i]
>>
FULLY_FORESTED: Fully Forested
EXPEDITION_LEADER: Leader
EXPEDITION_LEADER_DESC: <<
	You are leading the expedition from this ship.

	If the ship dies, you die.

	Your presence also improves ship effectiveness by 40%
>>
VOTE_ANNEXED_STATUS: Annexed
VOTE_ANNEXED_STATUS_DESC: <<
	This planet is in danger of being forcibly transfered to a different empire under the galactic senate.

	Its people are fearful, and will no longer permit flying or FTLing the planet while the vote is active.
>>
VOTE_ANNEXED_BW_STATUS: Fearful
VOTE_ANNEXED_BW_STATUS_DESC: <<
	This planet is under an annex vote.

	Its people are fearful, and will not permit transfering resources off the planet while the vote is active.
>>
ANCIENT_GENOCIDE_STATUS_DESC: There might have been something under that building before we built it.
CREATING_NEBULAE: Forming Nebulae
CREATING_NEBULA_DESC: <<
	This Gas Giant is preparing for a controlled explosion to create a nebulae in its system.

	The planet cannot be moved during this process.
>>
STATUS_WELFARE: High Welfare
INTERSTELLAR_TRADE_DESC: <<
	Guides trade ships to allow this planet in deep space to import resources

	[img=ResourceIcon::2;22]Drains 20 [b][color=#42b4bd]Energy[/color][/b] per second.[/img]
>>
INTERSTELLAR_TRADE: Interstellar Trade Beacon
STARFORGE_DESC: <<
	A highly advanced construction yard that rips power and material straight from the outer layers of the star.

	Generates 25 labor (plus Metallurgy bonuses) per minute at the cost of slowly damaging the star in the system it is in. Upgrades can be constructed on the star forge to multiply its labor generation by the upgrade count as well as the rate at which it damages the star.

	All construction on a Star Forge has a 50% reduction in build cost compared to normal.

	[img=ResourceIconsSmall::11;22;#91692c][b][color=#91692c]Building a star forge or any of its upgrades requires large amounts of Ore mined from asteroids.[/color][/b][/img]
>>
STATUS_BLOCKADED_DESC: Some of the civilian trade ships carrying this planet's imports were shot down. As a result, the planet produces 1 less of a random non money empire resource for each stack of "Blockaded!".
LOW_ORE: Requires Ore
LOW_ORE_DESC: This planet requires ore in order for its production to be fully operational. Dysons Spheres only operate at 25% efficiency when lacking ore.
FRACTURING: Fracturing
FRACTURING_DESC: Explosives are being planted and detonated on this planet. It will be fractured into many tiny pieces after 3 minutes out of combat.
CREATING_WATER: Synthesising Water
CREATING_WATER_DESC: A mostly controlled explosion is being prepared to create enough water for an entire planet. The planet will be terraformed into water after 3 minutes out of combat.
GAS_GIANT_DESC: <<
	This planet is made of gases and has no solid surface. Building is still possible with floating constructions but much more expensive. It is better to make moon bases instead.

	[i][color=#aaa]Maximum population reduced by 1. Income reduced by §80k at level 1 and higher. Max population and income can be increased via moon bases.[/color][/i]
>>
STATUS_SINEW_BOOST: Intense operations by the flagship's energised sinew are rapidly repairing this fleet for the first 30 seconds of any combat.
FROSTKIN_OVERHEATED: Overheated
