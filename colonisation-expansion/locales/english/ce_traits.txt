TRAIT_PARASITE: Parasite
TRAIT_PARASITE_DESC: <<
	[vspace=3/][img=Revolutionaries;22]All owned planets produce only 50% of the pressure of their resources. Planets can be razed down to nothing to massively increase their resource production before destroying their resources.[/img]
	[vspace=3/] [img=ResourceIcon::8;22]Planet colony ships from planets not being razed move 75% slower.[/img]
>>
TRAIT_SUBLIGHT_DESC: We have not discovered any means to break the lightspeed barrier. No FTL drive, FTL generation, or FTL storage. FTL can be still be researched from in game actions but takes considerable resources.
TRAIT_JUMPDRIVE_DESC: <<
	Ships are equipped with jump drives that let them cheaply jump to positions within their safe jump range.

	Jumping outside of safe jump range is possible, but can cause damage to the ship and may drop the ship at an location away from the intended destination.

	Tractored objects can be jumped along with the ship but doing so costs much more FTL.
>>
TRAIT_WARPDRIVE_DESC: <<
	Unlocks the Warpdrive subsystem (for stations) at game start. This FTL technology can be taken additively with other FTL methods

Planets cannot construct anything.[/img] [vspace=3/][img=ResourceIcon::6;22]Resources are produced in orbit, no pressure capacity is needed. Motherships in orbit of a planet automatically gain that planet's labor income. [/img][vspace=3/][img=PlanetType::14;22]Artifical planetoids, ringworlds and planets with native population can construct buildings but do not produce all resources from pressure automatically and still cannot export labor.[/img]
WALKING: Walking
TRAIT_TERRESTIAL_DESC: No particular effects on gameplay
WALKING_DESC: No particular bonuses.
AQUATIC_TRAIT: <<
	Planets require a second water resource instead of food to reach level 3.
	Tile development and building construction are 10% slower.
	Crew subsystems have 75% more mass.
	Water Synthesis is available from the start and cheaper
	All colonised planets with water biomes become happy.

	Why venture into outer space when you can bring your home with you?
	[vspace=6/][img=PlanetThruster * 44ffbb;22]Special Planetary Engines are constructed on all colonised planets, with 1.25 u/s² of acceleration and no cost. These will revert to normal engines if the planet is lost.[/img]
	[vspace=6/][img=ResourceIcon::8;22]Colonise planets by bringing other planets to them[/img]
	[vspace=6/][img=ResourceIcon::6;22]Resources cannot be traded. Instead, resources are transfered between nearby planets[/img]
	[vspace=3/] [img=AttributeIcons::3;22]Fleets operate at 50% effectiveness when far away from owned planets. This does not apply to stations.[/img]
	[vspace=6/][img=techConstruction * #30a67a;22][b]Station Sustenance[/b] is unlocked from the start and can be unlocked again (multiplying orbital maintenance decreases).[/img]

TRAIT_SCIENTIFIC_DESC: Start the game with 1 additional research income per second.
TRAIT_WORMHOLE: Wormhole Network
TRAIT_WORMHOLE_DESC: Civillian ships in owned space passively spawn small wormholes connecting your systems and planets together.

TRAIT_DECENTRALISED: Decentralised
TRAIT_DECENTRALISED_DESC: Loyalty on planets is reduced by 0/1/3/5/7/9 depending on level.
TRAIT_LIGHT: Light
TRAIT_LIGHT_DESC: All ship and station mass reduced by 10%. This reduces mass based FTL costs and increases acceleration.
TRAIT_HEAVY: Heavy
TRAIT_HEAVY_DESC: All ship and station mass increased by 15%. This increases mass based FTL costs and reduces acceleration.

FLYING_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]Free as a bird[/i][/color]
	A race capable of flight, taking great pride in exploring every inch of every planet, even those with no solid surface.
	[vspace=6/][img=ConditionIcons::1 * 33ff55;22;#ffff00]Can build on Gas Giant biomes with no cost increase. Gas Giant maintence and population penalties no longer apply.[/img][vspace=6/][img=PlateArmor;22;#FF0000]No matter how much you insist that Plate Armor would be a really good idea, you can't convince our engineers to put something so heavy on our space ships.[/img]
