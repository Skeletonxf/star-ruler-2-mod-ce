TRAIT_PARASITE_DESC: <<
	[vspace=3/][img=Revolutionaries;22]All owned planets produce only 50% of the pressure of their resources. Planets can be razed down to nothing to massively increase their resource production before destroying their resources.[/img]
	[vspace=3/] [img=ResourceIcon::8;22]Planet colony ships from planets not being razed move 75% slower.[/img]
>>
TRAIT_SUBLIGHT_DESC: We have not discovered any means to break the lightspeed barrier. No FTL drive, FTL generation, or FTL storage. FTL can be still be researched from in game actions but takes considerable resources.
TRAIT_JUMPDRIVE_DESC: <<
	Ships are equipped with jump drives that let them cheaply jump to positions within their safe jump range.

	Jumping outside of safe jump range is possible, but can cause damage to the ship and may drop the ship at an location away from the intended destination.

	Tractored objects can be jumped along with the ship but doing so costs much more FTL.

WALKING: Walking
TRAIT_TERRESTIAL_DESC: No particular effects on gameplay
WALKING_DESC: No particular bonuses.
AQUATIC_TRAIT: <<
	Planets require a second water resource instead of food to reach level 3.
	Tile development and building construction are 10% slower.
	Crew subsystems have 75% more mass.
	Water Synthesis is available from the start and cheaper
	All colonised planets with water biomes become happy.
